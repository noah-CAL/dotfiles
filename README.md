# Linux Development Environment Setup

This is my set of `bashrc` files and setup scripts needed to recreate my development environment.

Platform: Windows 11 WSL2 running Debian kernel.

## Installation

Clone this repo into `~/dotfiles`.

Any scripts in `setup/` must be run from the `~/dotfiles` directory. 

## TODOs
+ WSL2 setup
